# Clustering_On_Graph_Data

Clustering , is a unsupervised technique in machine learning used to cluster similar class data.

## Packages used in the notebook are:
1.networkx

2.stellargraph

3.matplotlib

4.sklearns kmeans

5.numpy

6.tensorflow

7.pandas

In this file we had used "movie_actor_network.csv" , is a datset containing bipartted graphs with nodes and edges in it.

we had used custom cost functions ( mentioned in the iptyhon notebook ) and applied the clustering algorithm on it to get the maximum cost.

and the the model is trained on best hyoer parameter and node embeddings after clustering are visualized using T-SNE
